2025-06-13 19:24:16,"Dear Diary,
Today felt like a long, slow slide into an empty room. The sun looked weak, and the breeze felt heavy. I spent the afternoon staring out the window, watching the world go by without me. It's like a part of me is missing, a piece that used to bring joy, but now just leaves a hollow ache. I keep thinking about the things I used to love, the things I used to do, and now they feel distant, like a faded photograph.
I can't shake this feeling of sadness. It feels like a weight on my chest, a constant reminder that things are not as they should be. I don't know when it will pass, or if it ever will. 
Goodnight.",0.8889,Very Positive,You seem really happy today! Keep spreading positivity ✨

2025-06-13 19:54:51,"Today started off on a stressful note. I got stuck in heavy traffic on my way to work, and ended up arriving late. As soon as I walked into the office, my manager confronted me about my tardiness, which only added to my anxiety.

I felt my heart rate skyrocket and my palms start to sweat. All I wanted to do was run to the bathroom and cry. I hate being late, and I felt like I was already starting the day off on the wrong foot. As the day went on, my anxiety gradually subsided, and I was able to focus on my work and be productive.

Next time, I hope to remember to pause and take a few deep breaths while I remind myself that the traffic was out of my control. I couldn’t have predicted the delay, and I did the best I could under the circumstances. I also need to remember that being late once doesn’t make me a bad employee.

In the future, I’ll try to leave earlier to avoid getting stuck in traffic, but I also know that sometimes unexpected delays happen, and it’s important to be kind and patient with myself when they do.",,Fear,Something’s worrying you. Talk it out with someone you trust 🫂

2025-06-13 19:57:14,"Last night, I dreamed I was flying over the ocean, soaring through the sky with my arms outstretched. The sun was shining bright and the sky was a brilliant shade of blue. I felt a sense of freedom and exhilaration as I flew higher and higher. As I looked down, I could see the waves crashing against the shore and schools of fish swimming in the clear water. Suddenly, I felt a gust of wind and began to lose altitude. I panicked and flapped my arms frantically, trying to stay afloat.
